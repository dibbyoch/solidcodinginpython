# solidcodinginpython


I have made an attempt to demonstrate SOLID coding techniques in Python.I have used Repl to make the python file.

The first example of SOLID coding techniques is 

#Single Responsibility Principle

according to it a class should have only one job. So if a class or function has more than one responsibility, it becomes coupled. A change to one responsibility results to modification of the other responsibility.

so as i have mentioned in my example I HAVE USED oPERATIONS function as the main function and broke it down to further smaller functions named as 

addition,substration,division and  multiplication 

instead of operations function doing all the job
